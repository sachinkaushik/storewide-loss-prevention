"""Seed kitchen food-safety violations into the SAD durable log.

Run once so the Hermes read tools (Get_all_activities, Get_activity_by_zone,
Search_retrospective_frames, Get_trend_counts, Get_all_zones) return sample data
during a local developer demo:

    .venv/bin/python scripts/seed_demo.py

Writes to the same persistent log the running MCP server reads (see config.py).
Re-runs are idempotent because each event carries a stable ref_id.
